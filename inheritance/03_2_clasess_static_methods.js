/*
  Static methods are methods relevant to all instances of a class â€” not just any one instance.
  These methods receive information from their arguments and not a class instance, which allows
  us to invoke a class' static methods without creating an instance of the class. In fact,
  we actually can't call a static method on an instantiated class object (attempting to do so throws a TypeError).

  We define a class' static methods using the static keyword. We typically use these methods to create utility
  functions for applications, as they can't be called on class objects.
